## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section involves visual exploration to understand the datasetâ€™s structure and patterns.  
It is divided into three parts based on the **UBM (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate)** approach:

### ðŸ”¹ **Univariate Analysis**
Analyzed individual variables to understand their distribution and characteristics.
- **Chart 1:** Count of Movies vs. TV Shows  
- **Chart 2:** Top 10 Countries Producing Netflix Content  
- **Chart 3â€“13:** Further visualizations covering genres, ratings, durations, release years, and trends.

### ðŸ”¹ **Bivariate Analysis**
Studied relationships between two variables such as:
- Type vs. Rating  
- Country vs. Genre  
- Release Year vs. Type  

### ðŸ”¹ **Multivariate Analysis**
Examined the combined influence of multiple factors (e.g., genre, rating, and release year) to identify deeper trends.
